Halogen example
===============

This example shows how you can produce a score from a VexTab script within a Halogen application (i.e. with a dynamically created canvas tag). Note, this tag must exist in the initial view before VexTab can be initialised.

Building
--------

From the current directory

    $ bower install
    $ npm run build

The code is built as example.js in the halogen/dist directory. This is runnable if you open the corresponding index.html.
